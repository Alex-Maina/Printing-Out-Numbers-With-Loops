# Printing-Out-Numbers-With-Loops
This is just a simple python exercise where a loop was used from 1-100 to print out numbers that satisfied various conditions

The Conditions

Use a loop from 1 to 100 and: 
1) Print the numbers that are divisible by 7 and 3
2) Print the numbers that are divisible by 7 but not 3
3) Print the ODD numbers divisible by 7 but not 3
4) Print the numbers that are divisible by the sum of its digits (e.g. 36: 3+9=9 39/9 = 4)
5) Print the numbers that are equal to the square of the sum of its digits
